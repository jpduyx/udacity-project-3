## TODO

small refinements to be made for specific queries, like the age at the time of the trip needs to be filled.

## NOTE 

I'm not sure if it is possible to do a 1 on 1 connection between payment and trip. 
Still have to figure out if this is possible with this data. But would like to concentrate on the other projects first.
